		Zodiac compatibility is something that cannot be taken very simply. It has complex rules and astrologers have been able to decrypt those after centuries
		of studies and observations. Add to this the complex movement of planets, which never stops, and you have for yourself a puzzle not many can easily	solve.
		The answer is as simple as the question. There are certain personality traits that make a Taurus and Gemini relationship work together perfectly. 
		Topping this list is communication and intellect, otherwise known as the level of maturity. In a relationship where the focus is only on such issues,
		there is no guessing it will turn out to be very good. However, in other areas where the two signs tend to be literally opposites, it gets a little 
		difficult and sometimes even rough, to get along. This list is topped by sexual intimacy, something that can kill a relationship before it can find a 
		sure footing anyway. Let us now look for reasons that explain how or why such situations occur.<br><br>
		This is as simple as explaining any other sign’s dating compatibility. Off the top, two major reasons tend to explain the zodiac love match of Taurus
		with Gemini. One of them, as you may have guessed if you read up on astrology quite regularly, is that of Taurus dates. This is very important as it
		comes directly from one of the principal roots of astrology. Compatible relationships in astrology are only a result of how closely do two people’s
		natal charts match.<br><br>
		The second reason behind why Gemini is not the most compatible with Taurus involves the zodiac elements. Earth will fare well with water, while fire
		will tend to grow more in the air. The two zodiac elements, which Taurus and Gemini belong to are, Earth and Air. It can be seen how these two do not
		go together at all. Earth is an element that favours permanence and settling down. This is something that the element of air’s basic principles is 
		against. Just like air in nature tends to blow across entire continents, the element also wants freedom and no strings attached to any relationship.
		This would lead to problems with compatibility between a Taurus and Gemini person. It can thus be safely concluded that Gemini cannot be considered one
		of the Taurus compatible signs.<br><br>
		There is a silver lining in every cloud that life puffs up. And based on that hope people have done much more in life than just finding their life 
		partner. Let us introduce you to the silver lining in this case: Communication and Intellect. <br><br>
		Be it a Taurus man Gemini woman case or a Taurus woman Gemini man case, the outcome is pretty much the same (except for tiny gender-specific details,
		of course!). These two signs do not have a lot in common, which leads to an overall incompatible nature. However, in these very dissimilar interests
		lies the reason for them to go forward as a couple.<br><br>
		Let us demonstrate with an example. In their free-spirited nature, a Gemini person might as well forget to do the basic stuff that is necessary. For
		instance, when going trekking, the excitement could be so much that they forget to pack the necessary things; a toothbrush for instance. It is moments
		like these that the ever-caring Taurus steps up and takes charge. Such cases bring out the true essence of communication between the two which makes
		one care for the other and lets the other realize how blessed he or she is to have the first person as their partner in life.<br><br>
		However ironic and unpractical it may sound; this is the only reason that makes Taurus compatibility with Gemini a possibility in a world where otherwise
		these two signs are usually seen at the throats of each other!<br><br>
