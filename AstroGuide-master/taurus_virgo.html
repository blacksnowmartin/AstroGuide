		Taurus and Virgo are people with sharp tongues and strong wills, but both the signs are truth seekers and are incredibly truthful to their partners, so
		a little criticism would not be a deal breaker. Taurus compatibility with Virgo is so strong that they make such a couple which leaves their friends
		shocked and speechless with their brutal honesty.<br><br>
		The trust which needs to be the foundation of every relationship, it is this particular relationship that exists between Taurus and Virgo which will
		provide you with the classic example of a truthful and honest relationship.  Virgo is among that zodiac sign that is most compatible with Taurus. Virgo
		is a total control freak they tend to have a very controlling nature which the Taurus does not like whereas, on the other hand, Taurus loves good 
		procrastination. However, when seeing Taurus compatibility with Virgo, we should be ready to experience dust-ups over their relationship timelines along
		with lack of motivation. But for the most part, Taurus and Virgo is a couple which is strong and enduring through thick and thin.<br><br>
		Virgo is a sign that does not trust anyone easily. This is because of the fact that they have Pisces as their opposing sign, and they tend to see every
		partner as a glimpse of the unknown in their life. Given this condition, it is not very easy to open up to such a person with enormous fields of
		possibilities in front of which you feel very small. Taurus, on the other hand, is much more relaxed in these circumstances and gives a lot of 
		importance to the beauty of sex. So, if the Virgo does not feel sufficient with their Taurus partner, it will be very challenging for the Virgo to 
		believe in their faithfulness and honesty. This kind of mistrust will not only hurt their Taurus partner but will also affect Taurus compatibility with
		Virgo greatly. As Taurus would not be able to understand what exactly they did to deserve this, and Taurus will most likely blame their Virgo partner
		for their changeable nature, leaving them thinking that Virgo itself is not that honest.<br><br>
		If Taurus can develop a relationship based on trust with their Virgo partner, then Taurus with Virgo will prove to be the Taurus best love match and
		will end up having the most compatible relationship with Virgo, as compared to the rest of the signs. Since trust is the most important element that
		exists in the relationship between Taurus and Virgo and are brutally honest with each other, but they also hold a lot of respect for their each other.<br><br>
		Taurus and Virgo in the glowing term describe each other as friends and family whereas they also have excellent dating compatibility as both are super
		romantic. Virgo which is a control freak in this relationship tends to take charge of the Taurus’s tendency where they overindulge by signing them up to
		gyms and sporting clubs. This couple will also make great running partners as well as tennis players. Both of them are competitive, but they are not 
		competitive enough to become extreme.<br><br>
		However, they are very caring and affectionate towards each other when they are in a relationship and Taurus and Virgo are known for making the best
		zodiac love match with each other because they have fantastic zodiac compatibility. So, when viewing their relationship in depth, we figure out that
		whether it is Taurus woman Virgo man or Taurus man Virgo woman both are a very compatible relationship. As Taurus tend to show most compatibility with
		Virgo. However, the only deciding factor on which their relationship is dependent on is trust because Virgo greatly relies on trust and it is essential
		for their partner to be truthful with them if they both want a successful relationship.<br><br>		
		The quality of the Taurus which makes them highly compatible with Virgo is their patience when they fall in love. Since Virgo will not be able to
		recognize their feelings right away, it will take this particular couple some time to set the strong emotional foundation. Virgo is always ready to go
		if there is lack of trust between them or some disappointment in this situation Taurus plays a vital role as they need to stay and never let a Virgo
		down due to lack of trust because this will leave them heartbroken. They should give their relationship enough time that develops strong trust between
		the two and let their feeling to evolve with each other.<br><br>
		It is considered for the fact that no other zodiac sign is as suitable for Taurus as that of Virgo. So, if a Taurus is lucky enough to find themselves
		with a Virgo partner they should not let them go easily. As both the signs are very sensitive and are afraid of getting hurt so it will be necessary 
		for them in order to build a deep and strong emotional relationship between them with mutual consent to have a healthy and a long-lasting relationship.
		However, it will also be important for both of them to not stay at a safe distance from each other for so long.<br><br>
