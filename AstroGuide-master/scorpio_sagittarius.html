		In strictly astrological terms, it is quite difficult. This is because of the involvement of many factors when it comes to Scorpio and Sagittarius
		getting together in a relationship. It is different if it is a professional relationship, though, because Scorpio compatibility with Sagittarius is 
		partially designed to be that way. However, you will realize the situation to its core once you get done with reading this article. We not only aim to 
		give you a detailed analysis on how it is like being in a relationship involving Scorpio and Sagittarius at its helm but also deeper insight on how
		these two got to the situation that they are in.<br><br>
		The first factor that astrologers believe intervenes in Scorpio and Sagittarius compatibility is the Scorpio dates. Any signs’ dates, for that matter,
		are important because they determine what positions the planets and other celestial bodies will be in. For two signs to be compatible, these planets
		must have at least some sort of a similar pattern between the signs’ positions.<br><br>
		Unfortunately for Scorpio and Sagittarius, their hopes of becoming a zodiac love match shatter when most of the planets involved do not really try in 
		getting close to the positions of each other. But wait, this is not the only reason that makes Scorpio compatibility with Sagittarius not work.<br><br>
		One more factor that stems from the very basics of astrology and is considered by astrologers to be decisive in ensuring dating compatibility is that of
		zodiac elements. As the theory goes, each zodiac sign is governed by one of the four zodiac elements, namely water, fire, earth, and air. Apart from the
		zodiac dates, these elements have their own rules of finding compatibility with each other. In this regard, one element is only compatible with one
		other element, translating down the signs they are responsible for too.<br><br>
		It is pretty easy to remember how this works out because this compatible relationship criteria works just like one would expect the elements to work in
		nature. This means a sign ruled by water will only be compatible with a sign ruled by the earth. Similarly, a sign ruled by air will only be compatible
		with a sign ruled by fire. Again, quite unfortunately, in the case of Scorpio and Sagittarius, the zodiac elements involved are water and fire. If one
		is to recall how these two act in nature, it is pretty easy to understand why astrologers do not really expect these two signs to get along so well.<br><br>
		At first in terms of sex, it may indeed look like Sagittarius is the most compatible with Scorpio. This is because when the fixed nature of Scorpio 
		comes in contact with the creative, outgoing Sagittarius, there is a sudden burst of sexual energy that both the people greatly enjoy. However, it is 
		very short-lived, as both of the people soon begin to tire of all of this. Sagittarius may think that Scorpio is too demanding and requires a lot of
		work done. On the other hand, Scorpio may think of Sagittarius as too imposing, someone who just would not let it go. This leads to friction between 
		them and both being apprehensive of each other in bed.<br><br>
		As everyone would agree, sex is not just about mutual understanding; it is also about being comfortable with each other, which is the very thing that
		Scorpio and Sagittarius lose when they get themselves into this situation.<br><br>
		If there is one factor that gives Sagittarius the chance of becoming a Scorpio best love match, it is their great ability to communicate and making any
		situation easy. In fact, Scorpio with Sagittarius, if it works out at all, only goes as far because of communication. However, it is not just a single 
		sided connection.<br><br>
		Although the doors are indeed opened by a Sagittarius first, they do need a proper welcome from the Scorpio too, which they do. A Scorpio feels very 
		light headed when communicating with a Sagittarius because of how they absorb in everything. For a Sagittarius, it becomes not only a source for great
		catharsis but occasionally when their Scorpio partner decides to speak up; they tend to learn in great volumes.<br><br>
		What connects Scorpio and Sagittarius is their mutual search for truth. Subsequently, they should find no problems in communicating with each other as
		long as emotions and trust issues do not intervene. Other than that, given enough time, both of these signs can turn out to be workable for each other.<br><br>
