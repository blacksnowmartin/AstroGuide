		When Gemini and Pisces get together, they are believed to make a compassionate couple. A Gemini is intellectual, smart, silver-tongued and has a very 
		good sense of humour. They are also good motivators and can help dreamy Pisces achieve whatever they desire. Pisces, on the hand, empathize very well
		with people and are able to connect almost immediately with people.  Talking about Gemini and Pisces compatibility, what brings them together is Gemini’s
		flexibility and the ability of Pisces to connect on an emotional level. Sometimes, they are also seen as twin signs.<br><br>
		Moreover, the zodiac love match not only makes them great lovers but good friends too.  However, Gemini tends to hurt people easily for they do not
		think before saying. Pisces being extremely emotional get their feelings hurt. While the two stars are likely to face troubles and conflicts, they are
		known for forgetting and forgiving easily. They don’t like holding grudges. While Gemini is too busy to hold a grudge, Pisces are too good-hearted to
		hold one. Gemini and Pisces hence like to live in the moment.<br><br>
		Pisces is a Water sign while Gemini is an Air sign. Gemini and Pisces make the best possible combination where one is intellectual, and the other is
		intuitive enough to make a bond that lasts forever. If they continue to work together as a team, they are bound to achieve much more. The most common 
		trouble that also influences their dating compatibility is the communication breakdown.<br><br>
		This mostly happens when Pisces feel Gemini is not considerate or when Gemini gets irritated by Pisces emotional sensitivity. However, as mentioned 
		before too they forget and forgive easily.  The best part about their relationship is their common interest in gaining knowledge and making the best 
		possible use of their mind. Gemini and Pisces similar interests, flexibility and well-matched personalities account for their zodiac compatibility.
		Hence, we would not be wrong to say that among Gemini compatible signs, Pisces holds great significance.<br><br>
		One of the best things about their sign is they are both very flexible and are good at accepting changing life conditions and experiences. When Gemini
		and Pisces act together as a couple that can change the situation in their favor. Their problems do not last long for both the signs do not hold grudges.
		Pisces love how Gemini keeps them motivated to learn new things in life. On the other hand, Gemini loves the open-mindedness and expressive nature of
		Pisces.<br><br>
		The good sense of humor of Gemini will always keep Pisces happy and in a light mood. Moreover, Gemini will adore the dreamy nature of Pisces, and hence
		Gemini best love match has to be Pisces.<br><br>
		When it comes to talking or expressing, Gemini is not always the kindest. Pisces are extremely sensitive, and they are not very good at taking harsh or
		sarcastic criticism. This means the chances of Pisces getting hurt by Gemini will always remain great. Moreover, while Gemini is all about thinking,
		Pisces is all about feeling. They might not always have a productive communication where both the zodiac signs might feel they are not understood well
		by their partners. This might result in serious problems so both Gemini and Pisces must cater to the needs of their partners.<br><br>
		Both the signs have good zodiac compatibility and can make the relationship work if they become sensitive to each other’s needs. Both the signs need to
		give each other respect and the much-needed independence. Overall, they can make a really good couple and can help each other grow more rapidly.<br><br>
