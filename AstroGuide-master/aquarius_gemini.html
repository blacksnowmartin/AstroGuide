		Two factors primarily contribute to any two signs being able to form a compatible relationship. Gemini with Aquarius banks on both of these as it moves
		on to foster some of the most beautiful as well as understanding relationships of all the zodiac sign combinations. The first factor that plays a very
		important role in a compatible relationship, according to astrology, is that of zodiac elements.<br><br>
		As astrology goes, the elements form the basis of compatibility just like they would act in nature themselves. In that bid, water tends to be very
		compatible with earth, as both help each other grow. Fire, on the other hand, is very compatible with the element of air because of how one acts as the
		fuel for the other. In another bid, it is also to be noted that two similar elements are always compatible with each other because their interests match
		so well even, they might get surprised.<br><br>
		In the case of Gemini and Aquarius, the stars aligned themselves a little too perfectly because both of these belong to the element of air. Some may
		even term Aquarius to be the Gemini best love match. In addition to matching interests, these two signs have something of a very similar approach towards
		life. Some people term it even more important than similar interests because these are the very things which carry a relationship. Where interests might
		only make you like each other, an approach towards life ensures that both of the people in Gemini and Aquarius go together in their path no matter what
		comes in between.<br><br>
		Gemini and Aquarius compatibility, while being termed as unique on many fronts because of the very good dating compatibility they have, however, the
		parameters to judge these compatibilities remains the same for all the zodiac signs in the calendar. Another one of the factors behind Gemini compatibility
		being so good with Aquarius is that of Gemini dates.<br><br>
		In any relationship, such as that of a Gemini and Aquarius person, a few considerations are taken in when determining to declare a combination of two
		signs compatible or not compatible. These include factors like trust, emotions, regard for values, etc. However, something that tops that list by a wide
		margin is sexual intimacy and closure. After all, if that is not achieved, how will a relationship progress beyond the third date? A Gemini and Aquarius
		relationship is very lucky in that regard. It might even be that the bed was just invented for these two to lay together!<br><br>
		Imagine a couple where one finds lying to the other ridiculous, while the other is comfortable enough having done anything that they would always trust
		their spouse with it. At this level of trust, one can only marvel and wish for the same in their relationships too.<br><br>
		As for emotions, this is a tricky ride. This is perhaps the only factor where Gemini compatibility with Aquarius tends to take a blow. This is not 
		because one is emotional and the other is not. The story is quite different here. Both of the people in a Gemini and Aquarius relationship might be so
		devoid of emotions that they would consider moving out of a relationship better than thinking with emotions and trying to solve the problem. This 
		abundance of straightforwardness is perhaps the Achilles’ heel of a Gemini and Aquarius relationship.<br><br>
