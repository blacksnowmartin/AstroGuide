		Few signs in the zodiac calendar show as good of compatibility as Gemini and Leo do It gets even more interesting because of the fact that typically,
		Gemini compatibility is a rather difficult issue, where if one personality trait matched, the other would go the exact opposite way.<br><br>
		It is not that it does not happen in this case. It does. However, it is so less that it can effectively be ignored in favor of the fact that there is 
		some sign with so much energy for Gemini.<br><br>
		The unmatchable dating compatibility of Gemini and Leo, or any other combination of signs for that matter, depends firstly on the positions of the 
		planets. The more each planet is aligned in its favorable position as compared to the other sign, the better Leo has chances of becoming one of the
		Gemini compatible signs. This effectively falls on the shoulders of Gemini dates, as they are what form the backbone of astrology and help astrologers
		determine the respective positions of planets and other celestial bodies in the skies.<br><br>
		In this sense, Gemini and Leo tend to be very lucky as a huge majority of their planets falls right where they are needed to be in order for the couple
		to understand each other better.<br><br>
		The second reason and this one is important because if you have been reading up on astrology, you will deduce it yourself halfway, is that of zodiac 
		elements. You see, the four zodiac elements have relationships with each other too. Some tend to go well with others, and not too well with the rest.
		Earth is always expected to favor the signs of water, and air tends to do the same for fire.<br><br>
		This crisscross of a relationship ends up building a compatible relationship if the conditions are right. In order for Leo to be most compatible with
		Gemini, it needs to either belong to the same element or belong to one that actively favors Gemini’s element. In a lucky bid, air and fire come together
		to form a relationship, so good Leo may as well be called the Gemini best love match.<br><br>
		Before we go on delving into the details of how good the sex life of such a couple would be, or how much they can trust each other, let us give you a 
		brief overview, as you are now well acquainted with the science that helps determine dating compatibility in astrology.<br><br>
		Gemini compatibility with Leo tends to be full up to the brim on nearly all the fronts. Both enjoy great comfort together in bed, both of them have
		equal regard for traditions and values, they even tend to have a mutually similar level of emotions.<br><br>
		However, there might be some trouble at the end of the trust, and these issues might as well become the cause of discomfort, or worse. The best way to
		avoid this is if you are in such a relationship is always to be honest to the core. And to tell out stuff to your spouse or partner before they have to
		ask you for it, as it gives them all the more reason not to trust you.<br><br>
		Although it does not really matter which combination goes on as the ultimate power remains only with the planets, this factor may affect some part of
		the relationship. It is so because astrologers ask for one’s gender as a necessary part in making their natal chart.<br><br>
		In terms of communication, Gemini compatibility with Leo is off the charts. It all takes root from how a Gemini has great regard for their partner’s
		knowledge. We all know Leos to be loud about what they know. The great thing about a Gemini is instead of getting offended by it; they choose to learn
		from it. And all the while increasing their own knowledge, they become a system of support for the Leo person who now relies heavily on their partner
		because they listen to them as nobody else does.<br><br>
		Gemini and Leo are again two signs with something beautiful that they should never let go of. Let us discuss how good they are at emotions and at their
		regard for values and traditions. It is only a matter of patience for both the signs to realize how perfect they are for each other, as both tend to 
		show emotions at a later stage of the relationship.<br><br>
		Being ruled by planets in charge of rationality, both the signs have great regard for logic and sense, which brings them closer not just in their
		opinions, but their approach towards life, which is perhaps the only important thing in relationships after all.<br><br>
