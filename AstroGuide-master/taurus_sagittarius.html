		There is a zing of attraction when a Taurus meets a potential Sagittarius partner; this relationship compatibility develops on a thin line of 
		commonality. The Zodiac compatibility of Taurus and Sagittarius is a slow process, where the Taurus offers their partner stability and common sense and
		the Sagittarius partner offers a sensual and adventurous feel to the relationship.<br><br>
		Making an exuberant mix of characteristics, developing passion and love into the relationship, the couple will discover more traits of their partners on
		this basis. For a marital relationship to work in a Taurus and Sagittarius partnership, it is important that the base is strong and is built on honesty
		and trust.<br><br>
		When Taurus and Sagittarius come together to form a relationship or start dating, they have little in common and the connection formed is due to the
		initial sensual pull of their bodies. However, this physical energy soon runs out, like for many other compatible signs and other energies based on
		intellect, emotions, and morals take over the signs to make it a compatible relationship.<br><br>
		Taurus compatible signs are often claimed to have a solid connection with their homes and have a strong commitment trait. They yearn for trustworthy
		partners in a relationship that can potentially lower their emotional walls and bring out a sensual personality. Not to worry, Sagittarius is one of the
		pieces of puzzles that a Taurus needs in their life. When a Taurus dates a Sagittarius, they can learn to be patient for Sagittarius partners as they
		will eventually find a home in their embrace.<br><br>
		A Taurus with Sagittarius doesnâ€™t need much to hold on to a solid relationship; they aim to hold an honest and trustworthy relationship. They mind
		being at home; instead, they find solace at home while reading a book by a fire. Sagittarius, on the other hand, has a wandering soul that needs to
		find assurance of their love and affection from their partners. They need a partner that can assure them constantly of their love as they fulfill their
		wanderlust.<br><br>
		This brings a hitch in the Sagittarius and Taurus compatibility because most Taurus partners do not handle the unsure nature of Sagittarius. For a
		relationship to thrive between these two signs there needs to be an incredible amount of trust and patience that can hold through the hurdles.<br><br>
		Both of the signs have very different, almost opposite, base emotions on which they build and structure their personalities. Taurus being a sedate
		personality and the Sagittarius being a restless personality does not bode well for them in the long run. The dating compatibility of a Taurus with
		Sagittarius can either break the stress of Taurus bull, or it can win a steady race of planned and stable emotions, no matter how restless they might be.<br><br>
		Taurus shows extreme reactions towards an unfaithful personality that has shallow emotions; it can be easy for a Sagittarius to fall into this trap.
		Sagittarius should learn to broaden their emotional connection with their Taurus partners to grow a steady relationship.<br><br>
		The Sagittarius and Taurus compatibility can thrive to become a beautiful zodiac love match if they learn to have excellent communication on their values
		and principles. They both seem to enjoy a tender connection of their souls achieved through the simple approaches to life. Taurus best love match needs
		have a tender and deep connection with their own values that they can share with their partner. If the Taurus and Sagittarius couple does not handle 
		their communication well then, there is a chance that they will have a weak compatible relationship.<br><br>
		The flirtatious nature of the Sagittarius and Taurus relationship can create a loving atmosphere of their dating life. It is important that the couple
		builds their foundation on trust that is solid and does not need to be checked now and then. Sagittarius becomes most compatible with Taurus when they
		use their fierce passions to stir the sensuality of their partners in an honest and loving environment.<br><br>
