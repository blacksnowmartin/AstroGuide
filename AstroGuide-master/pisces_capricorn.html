		When it comes to Capricorn and Pisces, zodiac compatibility could not be at a better stage. In fact, out of the entire list of Capricorn compatibility,
		the one with Pisces successfully remains in the top section due to its near-perfect score at everything that judges a relationship. In declaring
		Capricorn and Pisces a zodiac love match for each other, various factors come into play. These include the traditional methods of astrology that involve
		determining the compatibility of Capricorn and Pisces by comparing their zodiac elements, as well as more modern methods of tracking the planetsâ€™ 
		movements down to a single degree with reference to Capricorn dates.<br><br>
		While it is an exemplary relationship on all fronts, there are hiccups involved that may come as they please if the couple tends to get carried away.
		However, they are not something that should be the primary cause of worry. Let us move on to discussing this relationship at smaller levels, to form a 
		clearer picture of dating compatibility of Capricorn with Pisces.<br><br>
		Any relationship draws its fuel from the passion that the couple harbors during sex. It is also common knowledge that if two people cannot find harmony
		in bed, it is very difficult for them to get along in a compatible relationship either. For Capricorn and Pisces, however, it is not as difficult, as 
		they enjoy complete understanding in bed. Pisces goes on to become one of the most compatible with Capricorn, when it comes to sex and intimacy. The
		difference comes from one being very rational in all their decisions and actions, and the other one being quite flexible rules. This makes them see in
		each other a person they have longed to become for so long.<br><br>
		This is why astrologers believe that a Capricorn could never find a better partner than Pisces. Another surprising thing about the sex life of Capricorn
		and Pisces is that it will be spontaneous. Not even the couple themselves knows when the urge would rise to make love to each other. These surprises
		tend to keep the flame alive in the relationship.<br><br>
		Communication is one of the hiccups we mentioned earlier. It is not a very bad situation. It just brings Pisces down one spot in the list of Capricorn
		compatible signs. Just like being opposites of each other worked very well for Capricorn and Pisces regarding sex and intimacy, being the same regarding
		communication causes a little problem. Generally, both Capricorn and Pisces are known to be shy people.<br><br>
		If one was to take a Capricorn woman Pisces man couple as an example, they would notice that both the man and woman care a lot about each other. They 
		ask each other stuff when they are worried. However, unless asked, they do not tell. This is the problem with both Capricorn and Pisces. This lack of
		talking on behalf of each person, astrologers believe, could be the only cause that forms a rift between the two as they do not share enough 
		information.<br><br>
		Emotions bring Pisces back in the game of being a Capricorn best love match. The beauty of the emotional bond that these two holds is that it continues
		to build all their life and never stops. This makes them embark on a journey with no end in particular, but the contents of it being so interesting and
		mesmerizing that both Capricorn and Pisces wish that it never comes to an end. Adding to this beauty is the fact that both the people involved do not
		change themselves for the other. Getting to be loved by someone without changing one thing about yourself is another achievement in itself.<br><br>
		One thing is for certain. You can never expect a Capricorn to be dishonest. This is one of the primary reasons that Capricorn compatibility with any
		other zodiac sign tends to be one of the top ones in terms of trusting each other. Similarly, for Capricorn and Pisces compatibility, there is no
		lacking the element of trust.<br><br>
		If you are a person very fresh into a Capricorn and Pisces relationship, you might notice how both of you enjoy everything you do together. It is not
		about having the same interests, though. You may enjoy the things your partner makes you do that you otherwise refrained from, all your life. The same
		applies to your partner too. This kind of love is typical of any relationship at the start. However, as one progresses, this wane. Surprisingly, what
		makes a Capricorn and Pisces relationship unique is the fact that it does not happen in their case. Just like the attractive polar opposites that they
		are, Capricorn and Pisces continue on their journey together feeling happy when their partner feels happy.<br><br>
