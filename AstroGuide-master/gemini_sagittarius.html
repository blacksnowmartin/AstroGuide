		Gemini and Sagittarius are not only well-matched lovers, but they have the potential of becoming best friends too. They can communicate well as they
		tend to hold very similar views on life.  The fact that they are incredibly optimistic and enthusiastic makes them an ideal zodiac love match.<br><br>
		Sagittarius are mostly seen to be blunt and end up saying things they would not have said, had they thought before speaking. This implies they tend to 
		hurt people easily but since Gemini do not keep grudges; they will forget and forgive quickly. While Sagittarius is blunt too, the quality of forgiving
		and forgetting is found in them too. Both the zodiac signs lack the interest and time needed to hold a grudge.<br><br>
		Sagittarius is a fire sign while Gemini is an Air sign. This makes it a very active relationship. Air spreads Fire, helping it increase power.  This 
		best explains the sort of zodiac compatibility found between Gemini and Sagittarius. Since the signs are incredibly active, there is always something
		going on, and this might not be good. Sometimes, this might result in a real argument. This is to say, that being opposite stars, they go on extreme 
		levels. When things are good, they are pretty good and similarly when they are bad, things can easily go out of hand. Being dominant, they may fight
		over who is in charge.<br><br>
		However, the best part is that the argument won’t last long; they like to move on immediately. Both signs are ready to forgive, but one thing that
		Sagittarius would never comprise on is self-respect. They demand respect at all costs and this what Gemini understand. When in a relationship, Gemini
		compatibility with Sagittarius only strengthens.<br><br>
		Moreover, their dating compatibility is on point too since they like to live in the moment. They don’t tend to worry over little things and somehow are
		almost always fun to sit with. This comes at the cost of a huge sense of irresponsibility. Unless Gemini steps forward and decides to pay bills finally,
		the couple can hardly survive together. This might surprise the Sagittarius initially, but the Gemini will push their partner too. Hence, they together
		can turn into a responsible couple.<br><br>
		Yet another common thing about Gemini and Sagittarius Compatibility is they know which things are valuable enough. While theoretically, the two signs
		are incredibly different with Gemini recognized as superficial and Sagittarius as deep, they both are on common grounds in believing that everything
		makes sense and it is important to understand their existence.<br><br>
		This pretty much leads us to the conclusion that rationally and valuing things that make sense is inbuilt. They cannot digest anything that does not
		make sense or seems meaningless and will continue to dig deeper unless they understand the purpose and logic. Gemini and Sagittarius, thus, can enter
		into a very compatible relationship.<br><br>
		If any couple can understand better that the partner does not need to be faithful, it is the Gemini and Sagittarius power couple.  However, surprisingly
		they need up being most faithful to their partner. The reason behind this is that the charm in parallel relationships no longer exists as time passes.
		Eventually, they will turn to one another.<br><br>
		This does not make them a less compatible couple; in fact, their zodiac compatibility is well appreciated and recognized. They together, know how to
		adapt to changing circumstances. The best part about Gemini and Sagittarius compatibility remains to be there common interest in knowledge, productive
		communication and turning that conversation into reality. Hence, we would not be wrong to say Gemini best love match is Sagittarius.<br><br>
