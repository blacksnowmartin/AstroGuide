		<p style="font-size:20px;margin-left:6rem;margin-right:6rem;text-align:justify;">
		The compatibility between a Virgo and Aquarius can be rather surprising, as their inherent natures are somewhat different. Although they are so different,
		they are also able to see eye to eye on many things. Virgo loves to create structure and routine, and Aquarius likes to break down structures.<br><br>
		Virgo limits and restricts themselves often, whereas Aquarius seeks freedom, expansion, and spontaneity. Aquarians have a happy go lucky attitude, and 
		they see the glass as half full. Virgo’s can be rather critical and pessimistic, and they see the glass as half empty.<br><br>
		The reason they can make a good match if both are willing to put in the required effort is that the one can teach the other the qualities they lack.
		Virgo can teach Aquarius how to be more structured and responsible, and Aquarius can teach Virgo to become more spontaneous, outgoing, and daring. In a
		relationship, these two will always be fascinated by and interested in each other.<br><br>
		Virgo is known to be a healer and is at service to those weaker than them. Virgo works to help improve others to be the best versions of themselves they
		can be. Aquarius is a humanitarian, and their goal is to achieve justice and equality for all humans on earth. Their ultimate motivations are similar,
		and that is for other people to be happy and treated well.<br><br>
		Virgo is a practical earth sign, and they have their feet planted in reality with their heads screwed on right. Aquarius is an air sign with their head
		in the clouds and filled with many ideas and concepts. Aquarius is fascinated with how the Virgo can be so observant with such astute attention to 
		detail. The things Virgo thinks of are the things the Aquarius would never even consider to think of.<br><br>
		The Aquarius is hugely fascinated by the detail-oriented and perfectionist side of the virgo. The Virgo will likewise be just as interested in how the
		absentminded Aquarius seems to go through life without a worry in the world, or without a hint of a troubling thought or emotion. Virgo knows how to dot
		their I’s, cross their T’s, and have everything in place and in order. Aquarius cannot even get a hold or understanding of their own thoughts, and they
		will appreciate how Virgo helps them make sense of the confusing things in life.<br><br>
		The relationship or friendship between the Virgo and Aquarius is rarely dull and boring. It is filled with excitement. The Aquarius can get the Virgo 
		out of their comfort zone, and push them to try new things, more so than any other zodiac sign. Virgo will feel a sense of adventure when they are 
		around Aquarius. When two people with such different natures pair bond, it leads to exciting events and interactions.<br><br>
		Both Aquarius and Virgo are very rational with a zero-nonsense approach. They can both sense a tall tale and ingenuity a mile away, and they only include
		people into their lives that are genuine and real. Both Virgo and Aquarius have been used and disappointed by other people in their life, and they keep
		themselves guarded.<br><br>
		The relationship between these two starts casual, and over time the love and trust bond just get more durable and more reliable. Over the years, these
		two will become inseparable, especially if they have decided to take the step to get married. Virgo is a mutable sign, which means they can compromise
		and adapt themselves according to the needs of their Aquarius partner.<br><br>
		The Virgo will be required to take a backseat and allow the Aquarius their freedom. On the other hand, Aquarius is a fixed sign, and it can be 
		challenging for them to adapt and change themselves according to the needs of their Virgo partner. The Virgo will find it unfair that they have to be 
		the one continually evolving, but the Aquarius is not willing to compromise themself. There will be quite a few arguments between them regarding who 
		needs to change and adjust themselves to suit the needs of the other.<br><br>
		These two will have to work out their differences regarding the habits and traits they find annoying in each other at the beginning of the relationship,
		as if it does not get resolved over the long term, it could fester into serious problems.<br><br>
		Initially, these two will not interact with each other upon meeting. Both of them are too different for the other to understand, and in the beginning,
		they will keep their distance from each other, silently and secretly observing and studying each other from a range. Once they each feel that they have
		examined the other enough and that they know enough to initiate a conversation, they will. The sparks of romance and passion won’t be flying initially
		either.<br><br>
		These two are too different from each other to feel a sense of instant attraction, and the attraction between them builds over time as they get to know
		each other and as they become comfortable with each other. The Virgo and Aquarius will initially start as friends. The Aquarius needs to develop a bond
		of friendship with the Virgo before they can truly be themselves around them. Once the friendship bond is secure enough, then they will pursue a 
		romantic relationship. Should this romantic relationship not work, the chances that the Virgo and Aquarius will remain friends is very high, due to 
		them initially building a friendship bond before getting involved with each other romantically.<br><br>
		Virgo will initially be alarmed by the rebellious nature of the Aquarius. Virgo sticks to rules and regulations, and it can cause them anxiety when 
		their Aquarius partner just disregards the rules and does as they please. Virgo will find this behavior to be downright unsettling, however over time,
		the Virgo will realize that the rebellious nature of the Aquarius is harmless, and they can find it to be exhilarating over time, as they lack this 
		sense of rebellion and freedom themselves. The Aquarius can get frustrated with the Virgo’s constant need for assurance and stability.<br><br>
		These two have to find a middle ground between their different natures if they want the relationship to last forever. It is possible; however, it will
		just take some time and effort from both sides. The Aquarius must understand that the Virgo needs emotional and physical stability in their life, and a 
		flighty, irresponsible attitude will cause the Virgo a lot of frustration. There can be a lot of quarrels between these two, as they are both so 
		strong-minded that neither of them will back down and must say their say.<br><br>
		Both Aquarius and Virgo can identify the good in others. While other zodiac signs focus on the negatives, Virgo and Aquarius can identify the strengths
		in others, and encourage it. Virgo can seem critical, but their critique is motivated around the goal to help others improve, and it is not based on 
		negative or selfish motivation. To Virgo, awareness of a problem leads to a problem being solved.<br><br>
		Both Virgo and Aquarius just want what’s right for others, and this world. It is essential for them both to be completely open and honest with each 
		other as if the one feels the other is hiding something; it can cause long term issues. The key to this relationship is transparency. Generally, they 
		will both instinctively know that the other only has pure motivations, and this will cause them to trust each other fully.<br><br>
		There will be no lack of communication in this pairing, and this relationship will mainly be built on constant communication and sharing of ideas and
		experiences. Virgo and Aquarius will likely text each other all day when they are not together, and when they are together there will be an endless flow
		of communication. They work very well together as a team and can communicate instructions to each other very well. The Aquarius is always willing to
		help the Virgo with their tasks and duties. However, Virgo can often be too overwhelmed and busy to help the Aquarius. The Aquarius requires constant
		communication, or they can feel they are not valued, whereas the Virgo does not always need this continuous communication and requires copious alone
		time.<br><br>
		The main difference between Virgo and Aquarius is their openness to strangers. Aquarius loves to meet new, fascinating people and can converse with
		almost anybody. Virgo is a lot more discriminative and selective when it comes to who they interact with, and they will not understand why Aquarius is
		so kind to people they would never be kind to.<br><br>
		The Virgo will have to accept that the Aquarius can bring home many weird and wonderful people that they just met on the sidewalk. Virgo will have to
		keep their discontent to themselves and make cookies and tea for the guests while Aquarius rants on about their adventures and fascinating stories.
		Aquarius loves to have an audience to listen to them, and Virgo must allow Aquarius this, or the Aquarius can get lonely. Virgo must avoid raining on
		the Aquarius’s parade. Aquarius really values friendship and Aquarians call pretty much everyone their friend or best friend.<br><br>
		Aquarians are incredibly different and unique. Aquarius is the sign of friendship and humanitarianism, and an Aquarius will make the time for anybody
		who needs an ear to listen to their story. Aquarians often cannot understand why so many people find them strange or different and do not positively
		respond to their uniqueness. Aquarians have short attention spans, and their interest can chop and change by the minute.<br><br>
		The same counts for potential romantic mates. Generally, an Aquarius loses interest very quickly if a person is not impressive enough, but they usually
		do not lose interest in the Virgo. Virgo is very focused on the health and wellbeing of other people, and they go out of their way to help others 
		improve themselves. Together, Aquarius and Virgo make somewhat of a humanitarian couple that only has the best interest of others in mind.<br><br>
