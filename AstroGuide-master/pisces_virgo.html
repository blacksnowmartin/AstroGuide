		<p style="font-size:20px;margin-left:6rem;margin-right:6rem;text-align:justify;">
		Virgo and Pisces are opposite each other on the zodiac wheel, which will result in a magnetic attraction between two opposite signs. To each sign, the
		other represents the 7th house of marriage, love, and partnership, and there is a natural sense of harmony and mutual affection in this combination.<br><br>
		The practicality and earthiness of the Virgo will restore the structure in the life of the Pisces, and the spiritual and mystical personality of the
		Pisces will break down the walls and limitations that Virgo has created for themself and bring wonder and excitement to their life. Together they can 
		provide to each other what the other person lacks, which can lead to a mutually beneficial and lasting relationship.<br><br>
		Virgo prefers to look at all the little details of a situation. Pisces prefers to look at the bigger picture and not focus on the intricacies too much.
		These opposing viewpoints lead to a balanced partnership where Virgo tends to the tasks and details, and Pisces focuses on and directs their ideals and
		goals. Both signs are at service to others and the world.<br><br>
		They both offer a part of themselves up for the greater good of humanity, and they will find a shared understanding and connection through this. 
		Together they will work toward creating purity, peace, and hope in the world. If they could, they would end world hunger together. Pisces will find the
		analytical capabilities of Virgo helpful, and Virgo will find the “dream big” mentality of Pisces exhilarating. Together they can work toward incredible
		feats and make an impact on the greater good of humankind.<br><br>
		Virgo will find cleanliness and order to be necessary, whereas Pisces does not mind a little chaos here and there. Pisces is fascinated by the sense of
		mental organization that Virgo possesses that they lack themselves. Virgo will prefer to take the lead in the household and relationship, planning 
		everything and making sure all goes according to plan.<br><br>
		Pisces can affect the mindstate of Virgo with their magic and mysticism, and they know exactly how to bring a sense of excitement to the Virgo’s life.
		Pisces can remove the fear, worry, and anxiety from Virgo and allow them to feel at ease. Virgo will be able to identify how truly giving and 
		compassionate Pisces is and will return the favor by being sympathetic back to Pisces. It is rare for others to listen to Pisces, as Pisces is one of
		the signs which always lends an ear to talk to or a shoulder to cry on to others but rarely receives this themselves from others.<br><br>
		Pisces can break through the cold, calm exterior of Virgo and make them more compassionate and conscious. However, not conscious in a logical sense,
		more conscious of their emotions and the spiritual undercurrents around them. Virgo can also make Pisces more aware of the practical physical reality,
		and lessen the extent of how much they get lost in and live in their emotions.<br><br>
		As a water sign, Pisces goes with the flow of life. Their easy-going nature allows them to fall into the plans made by their Virgo partners intuitively.
		Pisces possesses an emotional character that Virgo remarkably lacks; however, they do need this emotional depth to become a suited partner for Virgo.
		Virgo possesses a practical sense of the world, one which Pisces desperately needs to settle down their emotional distress and confusion.<br><br>
		Pisces can let go, let it be, and just live in the moment, which is something that Virgo deeply struggles to do, as they tend to want to control 
		everything. Pisces can encourage Virgo to become more laid back and less strung. Most Virgos are workaholics who make little to no time for leisure and
		pleasure activities.<br><br>
		It will be essential for them to resolve any issues in the relationship as soon as any problems arise as if it is left unresolved resentment can build,
		and because both signs tend to favor isolation, they can completely isolate themselves from each other. They need to remember what made them fall in 
		love with each other initially, and not focus on the negatives in the relationship. Each of them can bring fulfillment to the other’s life, but they
		must keep their eye on the bigger picture, and not worry about frivolities.<br><br>
		When a Virgo dates a Pisces, they will have an emotional depth and connection between them that only some dream to have. Virgo partners lack confidence
		in sexual matters, which they hide under their rational minds and cool, calm exterior. Pisces can also be shy during physical connections, and they will
		instantly dismiss the shyness of their partner through mutual understanding. Their sexual lives will be governed by their inherent need for a passionate
		relationship, which will be free from judgment and filled with love.<br><br>
		Pisces is the dreamer, and Virgo is the realist. Both virgo and Pisces are sensitive and have complex emotions, and this combination results in long-
		lasting relationships and partnerships based on mutual understanding. Both tend to be more introverted and will focus on the relationship and 
		self-development over the outside world.<br><br>
		Virgo will always encourage Pisces to be the best version of themselves they can be through applying their focus to good, as Pisces will learn and adopt
		the hardworking traits from virgo. If there is any zodiac love match that deserves to have a happily ever after, it’s definitely got to be Virgo and 
		Pisces. Both signs fit together so much that there are little worries in their life together. Virgo and Pisces can build a loving home by combining the
		emotional touch of Pisces and the practical touch of Virgo.<br><br>
		Trust and commitment between Pisces and Virgo can take time to develop. There is usually not an instant attraction or connection, and the allure between
		these two builds over time through fascination through observing each other. Virgo might feel that Pisces is not fully invested in the relationship in 
		the beginning, which can cause ups and downs.<br><br>
		Over time, Virgo will realize that after many attempts, they cannot change their Pisces partner and that Pisces has their way of showing love and
		affection. Virgo might struggle to trust and put faith into Pisces with serious responsibilities and tasks, as Virgo can feel that Pisces is too 
		unfocused and irrational to be responsible. Virgo needs everything to be a certain way; they are obsessed with structure and routine, where Pisces just
		goes with the flow. There can be conflict in this relationship regarding who needs to take responsibility in the day to day tasks, and they need to reach
		a mutual understanding when it comes to control and power in the relationship.<br><br>
		In the beginning of the relationship, there can be minor communication problems. Virgo is ruled by Mercury, which is the planet that represents 
		communication, and this makes Virgo extremely communicative and verbally expressive. Virgo talks fast and likes to get to the point quickly. Pisces does
		not have such a knack for putting their thoughts into words and can find it challenging to tell Virgo what they think or feel.<br><br>
		It might take Pisces longer to get the right words together and to say them, as they tend to have a lot of confusing conflicting thoughts running 
		through their minds. Virgo can find this frustrating and think that Pisces is distant and elusive. Pisces will encourage the Virgo to see the good, and
		the best in a situation or person, instead of solely focusing on the negatives.<br><br>
		Both Pisces and Virgo are feminine signs. Thus both of them will tend to be more introverted, sensitive, and emotionally in touch with themselves. Both
		of these signs enjoy being alone and in their own space where they can do what they want to do without disruptions. Together they can create a harmonious
		bubble between them, where they live in their own space together, not needing the outside world.<br><br>
		It will be necessary for Virgo to know where the relationship is going, and what the ultimate purpose and goal of the relationship is. Virgo will 
		struggle to adapt to the “go with the flow” mindset that Pisces has, and Pisces will have to be transparent, open, and honest toward Virgo to be sure 
		they do not mess with their feelings. Virgo appreciates a partner who is upfront and honest, as they do want to have to spend hours or days analyzing a
		person or situation.<br><br>
		Pisces and Virgo both share the ideal of wanting what is best for the world. It is very likely to find a Virgo-Pisces couple involved with charity 
		organizations during their free time and offering up volunteer work. Pisces tend to listen to others all the time and never to let themselves be heard.
		Virgo will make Pisces feel comfortable opening up and communicating with them, and Pisces will feel they can share anything with the Virgo, without
		being judged or criticized.<br><br>
		Both these signs understand and appreciate the other’s sympathetic nature. As they are both mutable signs, they will be able to communicate with each
		other easily and share ideas about most topics. They will be more than willing to change and adapt themselves if it is necessary for the progression of
		the relationship.<br><br>
