		Being fixed signs, both Leo and Aquarius possess independent personalities that have a tremendous amount of personal magnetism. Each sign has the 
		stubborn traits that can make them a bit awry in a relationship. However, their pragmatic qualities make them the best zodiac love matches.<br><br>
		Leo with Aquarius can have a perfectly fitting companionship, where Leo needs to be the center of attention, while Aquarius tends to gravitate towards
		eccentricity in a social gathering. These signs will be instantly intrigued by their partners for a compatible relationship.<br><br>
		Leo and Aquarius have very different values pertaining to love. Leo dates those signs that can make them feel special; they love to be the center of 
		attraction for their lover. While Aquarius leans towards more intellectual affairs of love, based on mutual values and principles. If the right Leo
		personality falls for an equally matching Aquarius partner, then they can have excellent zodiac compatibility.<br><br>
		Aquarius often builds their own world with visionary ideas and inspiration from their own values; they have an air of nonchalance that exudes an aura of
		uniqueness, which fascinates Leo. Leo has royal and regal natures that love luxurious things because of their rarity; they find uniqueness a very 
		attractive quality. Aquarius’ unusual and exciting behavior makes Leo want to find out more about them, this attraction is one of the reasons that makes
		Aquarius most compatible with Leo.<br><br>
		Conversely, Aquarius lacks the social graces that Leo possess; they are charmed by the passionate nature of Leo. The dignifying interest and royal 
		appearance of a Leo are deemed as admirable qualities by Aquarius. Leo Compatible signs are put off by the flamboyant nature of Leo. However, it works
		in favor of Leo and Aquarius compatibility to amplify the attraction they will for each other.<br><br>
		As opposing signs, there is a fiery and magnetic attraction between Leo and Aquarius. They can become the greatest couple of all times because of their
		excellent sexual and romantic compatibility. Aquarius has the ability to bring down the king of the zodiac down to their knees and make them head over
		heels in love. Leo has a passionate nature that is entirely absorbed by their Aquarius partner, due to which they have an exciting and incredible 
		sexual attraction that has romantic undertones.<br><br>
		The romantic compatibility of Leo and Aquarius has the ability to blend two very different worlds that work together in the best ways possible. Not only
		does Leo and Aquarius compatibility grow on their physical attraction, but they also have a deep intellectual connection. The aloof and unique ways of
		Aquarius makes the romantic and the sexual world of their partner very interesting as they never say no to being a little bit extra or kinky, making them
		Leo best love match for sure.<br><br>
		Leo and Aquarius compatibility has one big hurdle that can cause this strong relationship to crumble and fall apart; it is the need for superficial 
		adoration in Leo. Leo has a royal and regal nature that naturally needs attention, be it real or fake. Aquarius is not equipped to provide this 
		adoration to their Leo partners as they do not know how to show superficial devotion to their partners. Most of the times, Leo is so besotted by their
		Aquarius partner that they do not allow such simple hindrances to cause an issue in the relationship.<br><br>
		Nonetheless, Leo and Aquarius have visionary qualities that can make a fantastic and quirky relationship that has the potential to reach success in leaps
		and bounds. Aquarius possesses a flexible nature that is not often affected by Leo’s nuances; they provide the love and affection to their partners in
		just the right doses. Leo has royal elegance and magnetism that can attract an Aquarius from miles.  Not to mention both signs possess mutual qualities 
		of commitment and loyalty, that can make Leo and Aquarius relationship last for a very long time.<br><br>
		Even though Leo and Aquarius compatibility allows a lot of ease in the development of a strong and emotional bond of love, there might be some hurdles
		that the partners have to go through. However, the mutual attraction of both signs can make the relationship last a long time, as Leo and Aquarius can
		become smitten with each very easily.<br><br>
