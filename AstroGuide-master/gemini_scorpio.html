		The zodiac compatibility of Gemini and Scorpio is built on a tumultuous path, filled with destructive forces with a dash of potentially intense energies
		that can work in their favour. Both signs have independent traits honed by their elemental signs and their ruling planets; each has their eccentric way
		of dealing with their partner. The Gemini lover has to be surrounded by the people they love, even in a relationship. On the other hand, the Scorpio
		lover has an innate passion for an intense and private relationship with their partner.<br><br>
		The intense intellectuality can be a turn on for the Scorpio partner as they love to dig deep into the minds of their partner, it might be their favourite
		game in a relationship. Even if the sexual compatibility of Gemini and Scorpio is hanging on to straw, the romantic bond between the two can be a saving
		grace that makes it a compatible relationship.<br><br>
		Even though Gemini tends to have an eccentric personality that can get in the way of their partner, it still has the romantic touch. A Gemini with 
		Scorpio partner can easily enjoy their life as a social butterfly by honing this romantic trait in their personality. Scorpio is one of the most intense
		zodiac signs; it does not accept things by halves. Scorpio needs at least one or two traits of their partners that can co-exist with their traits.<br><br>
		When a Gemini dates a Scorpio, they can flirt and flatter their way into a relationship by just broadening their horizons towards romantically. Not only
		will it improve their Gemini compatibility but it will also make them compatible sexually. Once the Gemini and Scorpio couple finds a stable space between
		the sultry and the adventurous, they can establish a very close and strong bond that can flourish romantically as well.<br><br>
		The flirtatious nature of Gemini and Scorpio leaves little to be desired as they have one of the dating compatibility, considering the odds against their
		relationship. Scorpio becomes most compatible with Gemini due to their instant fascination with each other that quickly turns into a game of affection
		and intimacy.<br><br>
		The flirtatious commonality leads this zodiac love match never to get bored with each other; they don’t need to talk it out. What Scorpio want, they get,
		even if they have to sacrifice some of their primary traits. It is one of the reasons why Scorpio can be considered as a part of the list of Gemini
		compatible signs.<br><br>
		Nevertheless, this tug-of-war between the signs is not effective in a long-term relationship. Gemini and Scorpio will eventually find better, more 
		interesting people that they can play the game of love. Not that the relationship will lose grace, or the Gemini and Scorpio compatibility will 
		fall-short, rather they will have a bombastic separation due to their differences.<br><br>
		The depth of the emotional bond between a Gemini and Scorpio couple is very shallow. The emotional bond in a Scorpio and Gemini compatibility test ranks
		the lowest; this trait is the reason many other bonds based on emotion are ruined as well. Gemini best love match must have a stable and steady flow of
		romantic emotions that they can show their partner that the Scorpio does not possess. Scorpio readily gives an intense flow of sexual and romantic 
		emotions that can pressurize their Gemini partners.<br><br>
		Both partners exist at different ends of the emotional scale. However, both need and yearn for the romantic emotion. Scorpio needs a deep emotional
		bond as much as they can readily give, whereas, Gemini does not offer much emotional depth but needs little emotional support here and there. The Scorpio
		will need to understand and accept the social nature of their partner as Gemini cannot be bound and kept home without turning the whole relationship
		into an utter disaster. The Scorpio cannot stand the social nature of Gemini. They have an emotional and private demeanor that can be easily irritated 
		by the sociable presence of the Gemini. The relationship compatibility of this combination can easily falter because it may be built on brief moments
		of lust that is purely physical.<br><br>
