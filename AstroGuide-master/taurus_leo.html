		Taurus and Leo have good zodiac compatibility due to the fortunate astrological commonality shared. The sun rules Leo, while the Taurus is ruled by the
		sensual Venus. Both zodiac signs share a luxurious and sensual nature that the planets also represent. The Leo and Taurus compatibility thrives in the
		loyalty and the romantic characteristics of the planets.<br><br>
		The issue arises when we focus on Taurus and Leo being fixed signs, which is considered as one of the worst combinations for a zodiac love match. One of
		the reasons that the Taurus compatible signs are often fluid is that they need a less forceful personality that can handle their stubbornness.
		Incidentally, Leo shares a contradicting trait with Taurus’s stubbornness; they hold a prideful personality that does not step down under the pressure
		of their partner. The partnership suffers greatly due to these traits in Taurus and Leo signs and decreases the chances of it becoming a compatible
		relationship.<br><br>
		It is important to remember that the Taurus sign is a strong earth sign that can be scorched by the fiery nature of the Leo fire Sign. A Taurus with Leo
		cannot handle the extreme emotional and passionate demands of their partner; it simply might be too much for their stable life. Leo can become a Taurus
		best love match if they can tone down their aggressive emotional nature and the constant emotional demands. On the other hand, the zodiac compatibility
		may also cause the Taurus partner to squash the enthusiastic nature if their Leo partner by dampening or disheartening their fiery advances in a sexual
		or a romantic bond. It can be said that the right amount of romance and emotions can truly save this zodiac love match and make it into a courtesan
		dream.<br><br>
		Every relationship has some potential pitfalls that can ruin the affection or passion of the initial match. The dating compatibility of Taurus and Leo 
		suffers from this conundrum; it has several points of contact that don’t match together. They have a residual resistance in their bonds, even after the
		Taurus and Leo couple starts to date. The Leo become most compatible with Taurus partners if they learn to live a little by giving into the demand of 
		their partner. On the same line, the Taurus partner needs to tone down their stubborn nature and accept the passionate advances of their Leo partner.<br><br>
		Let’s get this straight, the Leo and Taurus compatibility is not all that great from the start, their emotional connection being the weakest link. The
		emotional traits of the Taurus sign run deep, it holds a strong position in the material world. However, the Leo expresses exuberant emotional traits
		that are filled with creative and passionate energies. Taurus and Leo couple can never feel this bond together as they share different values of love.
		However, it is completely possible for a Taurus and Leo couple to improve their relationship compatibility by forming a bond through friendship and
		their giving traits. This will reduce any animosity that could develop in case that the two signs butt heads together offer an emotional issue.<br><br>
		Finally, we can say that the saving grace of the relationship compatibility of a Taurus and Leo couple is the romantic and regal traits that they share.
		They can build a strong-hold relationship based on their lifestyle choices and interest. With a dash of generosity and trust, Leo and Taurus 
		compatibility can greatly improve over time.<br><br>
