		When you go to an astrologer to know more about your personality, the future, or zodiac compatibility prospects, for instance, the first thing you are
		asked of is your date of birth. This goes on to show how important Gemini dates are in determining their compatibility with Capricorn. In order for you
		to find your zodiac love match, both of the people in a relationship must have similar planetary positions in their natal charts to some extent, at
		least.<br><br>
		It is totally understandable that no two natal charts can be completely alike, however, achieving near perfection in the positions of the planets has 
		always been one of the primary attempts behind a compatible relationship. Dating compatibility can thus be easily put on the shoulders of zodiac dates.<br><br>
		Ever heard of water and fire living together? Pretty much the same is the case with Gemini and Capricorn. As it happens, Gemini compatibility is greatly
		reliant on a matching of zodiac elements in their true sense, just like the compatibility for any other sign. As the theory goes, out of the four zodiac 
		signs (earth, fire, air, and water) only a few tend to favour the other few.<br><br>
		To easily understand who goes in favor of whom, one has to recall how things go about in nature. Just like fire and water do not go together, earth and
		air do not too. Coincidentally, air and earth are the very signs of Gemini and Capricorn too, respectively. This is one more reason that stops these two
		signs from becoming the zodiac love match for each other.<br><br>
		When we establish that two signs are not compatible with each other, we mean there are a lot of factors in which their preferences differ. This includes
		the two peopleâ€™s approach towards life, their general interests, and the likes.<br><br>
		However, as any astrologer or any common person too, for that matter, would tell you, the first step towards a stable relationship is closure and sexual
		intimacy. This first rung of the ladder for Gemini and Capricorn, unfortunately, is totally broken. In fact, that ladder is in such a bad condition that
		it might not even stand against the wall for long.<br><br>
		Focusing only on the sexual life, for now, however, we get to know that a Capricorn does not really think of sex as an important need of man. On the 
		other hand, Geminis are sometimes described as carnal animals in their personalities. Gemini compatible signs tend to favour freedom, liberty, and a
		desire to get exposure all the time. Due to such tendencies, it gets troubling because Capricorn is a sign that favours permanence, settling down, and 
		all things opposite to what Gemini wants from life.<br><br>
		The same goes for their regard for values. The surprise lies in the fact that while both have great admiration for certain qualities and values in other
		people, these admirations are each for a different set of qualities. While one favours outer beauty, the other favours discipline in a person. This
		conflict goes on to further divide the two if by any chance a Capricorn gets to try their hands at Gemini compatibility for so long.<br><br>
		However, there may be some hope in that regard. It is the factor of trust which brings Gemini and Capricorn a little closer to each other. However, this
		closure is nothing to get excited about. While the openness of a Gemini person, coupled with their takes on humour which may sometimes involve adult
		content is taken as humour by many, a Capricorn might downright be offended by it because of their self-righteous and pious behaviour. However, both of
		these people do tend to connect at one point in terms of the trust.<br><br>
		A Gemini is a person who will go for many of their decisions without much thought, based on impulse, whereas a Capricorn tends to put their brains in
		the gears before making any decisions. This ability lets them think ahead of how their Gemini partner would react in a certain situation. While many 
		people call this an unfair advantage, this is perhaps the only thing that lets a Capricorn trust a Gemini because they already know what they will do
		in any situation.<br><br>
