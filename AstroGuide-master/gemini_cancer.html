		Astrologers do not usually foster very high hopes for a Gemini and Cancer relationship. In fact, when looking at the general trend of Gemini compatibility,
		Cancer tends to fall somewhere in the bottom quarter because of the various differences that astrological principles throw towards it. It is important
		to know, however, that all of these principles stem from the very basic astrology knowledge.<br><br>
		Let us begin with a general overview of how a relationship between Gemini and Cancer as zodiac signs tends to work out. Before anyone would judge any
		relationship, be it an astrologer or a common person, they would have in their minds a set of rubrics or parameters to check for stability and all that
		is necessary for a healthy relationship. Some people tend to look for emotional compatibility, while others look for similar interests. People who
		follow astrology also tend to look out for sexual intimacy and closure between the two people. All in all, such factors come together to form an opinion
		on whether a relationship is healthy or not. This then goes on to become the decisive factor in Gemini compatibility too.<br><br>
		This is one of the most important, as well as the very first of things to come up when the success of a relationship is discussed. After all, as we like
		to say, the relationship will only progress beyond a certain number of dates if there is something each person longs for from the other in bed.
		Unfortunately, Gemini and Cancer do not share that spark. This is mainly because of the different preferences and expectations each one of these two has
		from the other about sex. One is the lie-in-bed and waits for its kind, while the other wants it all at once, and that too roughly. This mismatch leads
		to incompatibility. In short, it makes Cancer not one of the Gemini compatible signs, if sexual encounters are to be considered only.<br><br>
		Communication is the only thing connecting these two signs together and ensuring that Gemini compatibility with Cancer gets a stand. While no one would
		call Cancer a Gemini best love match, communication certainly tries to push the two together.<br><br>
		While many would argue that Gemini is a generally talkative sign and it does not really take much for them to open up, the certain nature of a Cancer
		tends to bring out more from that. A Gemini person would communicate on a more personal level with a Cancer than any other zodiac sign, which brings
		about mutual love among the two for each other.<br><br>
		There are many reasons behind a successful relationship, and astrology tends to have its own reasons that can be derived from the very basics of the
		subject. The case of Gemini compatibility is no different. Gemini and Cancer are governed by the same rules that apply to any compatibility tests in
		astrology. The first one among these works with Gemini dates. It is a simple belief that forms the foundation of astrology, which then goes on to be 
		the main pillar when finding compatibility between two zodiac signs.<br><br>
		Gemini and Cancer do not only tend to have differences because of their dates and different planetary positions. In fact, there must be at least one
		planet in a similar position for the two signs to have so good of communication between them. However, let us not get distracted and address the second
		reason, which is that of zodiac elements. These two signs belong to the elements of water and air. The combination of air and water does not really sit
		well. Water tends to be something that absorbs everything and is happy in any situation, while air people crave freedom and exposure, making their life
		priorities very different. This goes on to be the same in any case, be it a Gemini man Cancer woman combination, or a Gemini woman Cancer man 
		companionship.<br><br>
