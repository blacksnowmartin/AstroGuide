		You might also be familiar with the parameters that are set to judge a compatible relationship. These include factors like sexual compatibility,
		emotional quotient, trust between the two people and such. In a brilliant turn of events, Libra and Aquarius turn out to be a couple that is great at
		all of these factors.<br><br>
		There are a few hiccups being faced by Libra compatibility with Aquarius in the department of communication, but it is nothing that cannot be worked out.
		Sexuality is a complex issue for any couple. Nonetheless, it is the starting point for all kinds of dating compatibility charts. After all, if there is
		no heat generating in the bed between two people, they often see little reason to continue with that particular relationship. Fortunately for Libra and
		Aquarius, they smash it in bed, in a good way of course. Let us come at this analysis with both signs’ perspective, so you understand better what is at
		play here.<br><br>
		Aquarius comes in a relationship looking to be satisfied in bed, in all honesty. This gives them a lot of free hand with what they want to do. You may
		have heard about how shy a Libra person can be; this shyness is greatly countered by an Aquarius as they make their Libra partner feel comfortable in 
		bed. It may become some challenge because of Libra’s shyness too, at times. Being a zodiac love match, after all, is no easy feat. An Aquarius may have
		to work too hard at times when they want sex while their Libra partner doesn’t (in public places, for instance). Apart from that, these two are like two
		giant blocks that fit.<br><br>
		This is the tricky part in Libra and Aquarius compatibility. Both being zodiac signs governed by the element of air, Libra and Aquarius both have a
		tendency to explore new fronts in all departments. When we discussed how a Libra is very shy in nature, it is because of the influence of the Sun. This
		tends to inculcate in a Libra’s personality, great regard for what people would say in reaction to any action by them. This subconscious worrying of
		people’s opinions may get them to halt their sexual practices in wild scenarios that an Aquarius might otherwise suggest. But once they give in, both 
		of them enjoy each other to the fullest.<br><br>
		We discussed how sex and intimacy bring Aquarius to the list of signs that are the most compatible with Libra. Let us now move on to discuss some factors
		that work against this agenda. While it is nothing that serious, it sure does somewhat hinder the chances of Aquarius being the Libra best love match.
		This is the parameter of communication. The challenge to communication arises from the basic approach that each sign takes towards life. Libra wants to
		uphold a certain image in the society, of being applauded by everyone for their philanthropy as well as their light-hearted jokes.<br><br>
		An Aquarius, on the other hand, enjoys going in the exact opposite direction of every person in the room. This may lead to disagreements that are often
		not appreciated by either. However, these disagreements have an equal chance of disappearing too when, at certain times, the Libra’s habit to be unique
		in a room matches with an Aquarius’ habit of being the opposite of everyone. In such a case, Aquarius does tend to run back in the list of Libra
		compatible signs.<br><br>
		Fortunately for Libra compatibility with Aquarius, a lot of planets, including those responsible for sex, emotions, trust, and shared activities match
		up in their respective positions.<br><br>
		Similarly, the second reasoning that declares Libra and Aquarius to be the perfect match is that of zodiac elements. It is known among astrologers and
		people who follow astrology of how zodiac elements tend to form their own pattern of compatibilities. This involves signs with an element of fire
		favoring signs with an element of air. The same goes for signs of water and earth too.<br><br>
		However, the most successful compatibilities result when there are two similar elements on the charts. Libra and Aquarius both belong to the element of
		air, making waves. This gives them not just a shared approach towards life, but also similar attitudes towards the problems that might come in their
		way.<br><br>
