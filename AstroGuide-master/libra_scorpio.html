		Although they fare pretty well in the department of communication and might even end up satisfied after getting together in bed, there is little to go 
		beyond that. Of course, there are a variety of reasons that contribute to this mismatch, and instead of just commenting on the average situation of this
		couple, we feel it is important to let you in on the background story that goes on in ensuring a compatible relationship between Libra and Scorpio as 
		well as any other couples out there.<br><br>
		The first reason that is an active contributor towards the weak relationship between Libra and Scorpio, let us introduce you to the four zodiac elements.
		If you have come this far, you should already know what these are. The four elements play a very crucial role in determining dating compatibility as it
		is primarily their choice about which sign gets to be compatible with which.<br><br>
		As a ground rule, fire signs are only compatible with air signs (and vice versa), while earth signs are only compatible with water signs (vice versa
		again). In somewhat a misfortunate event, Libra and Scorpio belong to air and water respectively, inciting a bad start. Air signs generally tend to be 
		explorers. <br><br>
		They love moving out and experiencing new things all the time, and naturally, they would expect their partner to accompany them. Water elements like
		Scorpio are somewhat preprogrammed. They only like the tread on the paths they have tried already, and avoid any new confrontations, pretty much like a
		river flows its own course always. This mismatch is totally not the way to go forward, ending up in Scorpio not being a Libra best love match.<br><br>
		The second very important reason that contributes to Libra and Scorpio not being a zodiac love match is, in fact, the Libra dates. For confirming any of
		the Libra compatibility lists, it is important that the two people involved have similar interests and approach towards life. This is determined by 
		their natal charts and how similar the pattern of the planetary positions is.<br><br>
		While compatible signs show nearly perfectly similar natal charts, the one with Libra and Scorpio tells a completely different story. There are some
		planets that come in close, making factors like communication work in favor of the two signs, but apart from these, there is absolutely nothing that
		could declare Scorpio to be one of the Libra compatible signs.<br><br>
		Of course, this is what you have been waiting for all this while. Or did you skip right down to this section? However, we’re sorry, but we will have to
		disappoint you here. If you’re looking for good sex between Libra and Scorpio, it is rare, very rare! The reasons behind this are simple. Even though
		these two signs are ruled by Venus and Mars, which are two planets definitely made for each other, ensuring increased sexual contact and understanding,
		it doesn’t quite help out.<br><br>
		What drives them apart are the zodiac elements. In all truth, it is the speed and excitement of the air that does not fit well with the calm and slow 
		nature of water, making sex dull and unwanted by both of these together in a relationship.<br><br>
		This is something you surely need to be aware of and handle with care because emotions between Libra and Scorpio are nothing but a roller coaster ride.
		In addition to that, these are also another reason that Scorpio is not called a sign most compatible with Libra.<br><br>
		A reason behind this includes the fact that these two signs come in the zodiac calendar in a direct order, which means each has a direct influence on
		the other. While you may expect that to work in each other’s favor, it usually doesn’t. A technical word describing such compatibility is probably
		 overkilled. Libra and Scorpio tend to be so good at emotions together that it more than often goes into overdrive, resulting in drama, chaos, and 
		trauma at the end.<br><br>
		Part of it exists because Libra as a zodiac sign tends to be energetic and expressional, and demands the same kind of emotions as their partner too.
		But Scorpio is a calm, and smooth kind of a person, which results in an emotional mismatch.<br><br>
		There may be a lot of hiccups on the road to Libra compatibility with Scorpio, but there is not one thing that astrology cannot help out with. With
		realizing the problems that lie ahead of such a couple, you can always plan accordingly, know where to control your personality, and the end could
		always be better than you expected it to be.<br><br>
