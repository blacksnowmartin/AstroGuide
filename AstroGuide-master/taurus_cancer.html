		create a life of their own that has longevity and love as the bases for the relationship.<br><br>

		sexual appetites of either of the partners. The Taurus partner keeps healthy stability in the lives of their Cancer partner, while cancer provides 
		respect and friendship.<br><br>

		the features of nurturing their partners and spoiling them with attention and affection. They both possess a fairly high amount of the possessive trait,
		making them perfect partners for each other in a compatible relationship. However, the seclusion of the Taurus and Cancer couple may cause close family
		members and mutual friends to feel left out.<br><br>

		issue. This excessive emotional flow does not affect the Cancer’s place as a Taurus best love match rather; it improves its chances of being the best.<br><br>
		Cancer as a water sign nourishes the earth-based Taurus; it nurtures the mysterious ways of their partner, so they express themselves freely and fully.
		The earth-based Taurus sign soaks the flood of emotions from the water-based cancer sign, which helps them improve the Cancer and Taurus compatibility
		even further. These two signs can form a loving and romantic partnership that offers equality; it takes as much from the signs as it gives.<br><br>
		The relationship compatibility of a Taurus Man Cancer Woman Combination has a very good chance for lasting for quite a while. The Cancer woman is a
		very sweet and loving partner that can offer a safe environment to the Taurus man, who needs a stable home. Whereas, the Taurus man will have the 
		strength and the emotional security that cancer needs to improve the bonds of relations. The nesting trait of cancer is one of the traits that the
		possessive Taurus man enjoys greatly; it makes cancer one of the best Taurus compatible signs. The Cancer woman can have ups and downs in their emotional
		behavior, but not as much to irritate their Taurus man. Rather, the intellectual and kind nature of Taurus man is triggered when their Cancer woman 
		needs emotional stability.<br><br>
		True commitment begins with a Taurus woman Cancer man combination, the relationship compatibility for this zodiac love match has outgrown several other
		perfect matches due to its high potential. The Taurus woman receives the attention of their cancer man, who offers a flood of emotional affection and 
		love towards their partners. The Cancer man is an intuitive and emotional gentleman that has doubts and worries if left alone for too long. However,
		the Taurus woman has the deep connections with their partners that can develop into a solid commitment if matched with the needs of Cancer man.<br><br>
		Both Taurus and Cancer have relatively steady and secure attitude in a long-term relationship that can be designated as a true commitment of sort. The
		relationship compatibility offers a sensual and affectionate bond of love that can be intimate when the signs are given enough time together. The Cancer
		and Taurus compatibility flourishes when both signs understand and communicate with each other, they can develop a mutually beneficial bond of love and
		friendship.<br><br>
